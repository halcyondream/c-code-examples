# Vulnerable C Examples

Code to illustrate common C vulnerabilities. This was taken largely 
from the O'Reilly book, *C Pointers*.

For each example, you can compile it without any special flags or
dependencies. For example:

    gcc filename.c

Other C vulnerabilities that are worth mentioning but not yet 
exemplified here:

- Use After Free

- Integer Overflow/Underflow
